stack new my-project
cd my-project
stack setup
stack build
stack exec my-project-exe

stack install 
    # is the same as `stack build --copy-bins`
    # It puts the executable in `/Users/pascal/.local/bin`

--------------------------------

Edit files in the `src/` directory.
The `app` directory should preferably contain only files related to executables.

If you need to include another library (for example the package  `text`):
Add the package `text` to the file `package.yaml` in the section `dependencies: ....`
Run `stack build` another time.
`stack build` will update my-project.cabal for you. If desired you can update the .cabal file manually and stack will use .cabal instead of package.yaml.
If you get an error that tells you your package isn't in the LTS. Just try to add a new version in the `stack.yaml` file in the `extra-deps` section.
